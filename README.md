## About the project

This project is really young. I develop it because I like the "single tasking" concept and want to learn Android application development. I do it just for fun. I will keep improving this app and release new version early and often.

Currently it is only tested with my Galaxy Nexus.

If you have any issues, want to contribute or have some feedbacks, please create an issue.
